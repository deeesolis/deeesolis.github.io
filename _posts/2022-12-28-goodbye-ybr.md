PDXWIT volunteer, mentor, and member of the speakers bureau, Deana Solis is the inaugural FinOps Leader at Smarsh. She attended the first FinOpsX Conference and won the award of first FinOps Evangelist.

As the youngest of four, Deana became known as the most fearful of her family and had to learn how to conquer her fears at a very young age.

Throughout her career, she became fueled by her fears and found them to be a source of inspiration for her professional development, learning new skills, and heightened emotional intelligence. She believes we must acknowledge our fears and to know we have agency in our own outcome.

Tune in to hear how Deana’s fears helped her choose meaningful goals in life and how they’ve impacted her journey as both a mother and mentor.

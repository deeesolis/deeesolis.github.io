title:  "pattern or anti-pattern"

Our ability to adopt any optimal pattern may depend entirely on our capability to unlearn an anti-pattern.

One challenge to achieving this is that we must define an anti-pattern in its relevant context. For example an anti-pattern in the context of software architecture can be called a big ball of mud. That is literally a name of a known anti-pattern, so named because it resembles a mass of disorganized code lacking any observable structure, like a ball of mud. 

We can think about patterns and anti-patterns in nature if we look at them in the context of ecosystems. This is true for human systems, like corporate cultures and teams. 

How do we distinguis between an anti-pattern and an adaptation? The difference is the expected outcome. 

_n. anti-pattern
A commonly occurring solution to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences. 

“Organizations with a generative culture, people collaborate more effectively and there is a higher level of trust both across the organization and up and down the hierarchy”

Adapted from Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim on Westrum’s Organizational Theory in Technology Organizations  

We know so much about the right patterns in high performing teams because academics like sociologist, Dr. Ron Westrum published his studies

A generative culture can be good for teams because it can lead to more original ideas, better collaboration, and faster problem solving. In a generative culture, people learn quickly, innovate, and trust each other more. This can help teams perform better collectively than they would individually

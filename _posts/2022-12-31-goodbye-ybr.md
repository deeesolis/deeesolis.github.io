PDXWIT volunteer, mentor, and member of the speakers bureau, FinOps and DEI leader at Smarsh, winner FinOps Evangelist of the year.

If 2020 was the year I realized I wasn't invisible if I didn't want to be, and 2021 the year I learned how to use my voice, I have this year to thank for the opportunities to use those skills to in service of building community. Twelve months ago, you couldn't convince me I'd cohost virtual and in-person meetups, appear as a guest (even guest-host) on a couple of podcasts, and be asked to speak in rooms full of strangers in strange cities. Excited for what's next. #womenintech #womeninfinops #introvertsunite #fearasfuel

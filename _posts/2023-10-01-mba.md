Back in August 2023, Dr. Curtis Bullock hosted a virtual series for ThinkNW about navigating careers with and without an MBA. 

He asked why I decided to get my degree, and here's my recorded answer, courtesy

By now you've noticed I don't tire of talking about being invisible, but the way I talk about it has evolved and matured. It doesn't make me weak or strong. It is something I have learned to control. 

I understand well that when I am not perceived as an object to possess, I could be perceived as a threat. 
Invisibility keeps me safe. And if people choose not to acknowledge me, forget my presence, I am capable of gathering more information for making better decisions. 
However I might choose visibility when I need to influence or when my visible representation can serve my community. I hadn't thought of it in over a decade, but I knew at the time that three letters, M-B-A, would make me more visible. 

My degree from Portland State University paid for itself many times over. I was lucky that I found a local program that aligned with my values and served my needs. I considered it diverse at the time, but I'm not even sure I had the language to consider whether it was inclusive. 

I mentioned the challenge of inclusivity in selecting an academic program later in the [interview.](https://youtu.be/0jbf6ZnowMo?si=08Mc1OujOFNadrz2)

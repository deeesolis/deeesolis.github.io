Did I mention I'm an introvert? 

That I self identify as an introvert doesn't mean I have nothing to say. I do prefer to be quiet. Both things are true. 

I didn't expect to have much to say about building trust or fear as fuel, or intentionally fostering culture that aligns with my values. And still she persists...

## Deana Solis 
is the youngest daughter of Filipino immigrants and the mom of a biracial son. She and her partner love to cook together, take on a renovation project, and when the weather is right, kayak or paddle-board on the Columbia River near their home in Vancouver, Washington. 

Born in Los Angeles, California, Deana attended public schools from grades K-12, and played on baseball, softball, and volleyball teams throughout. She later studied at a community college and state universities in California, Washington, and Oregon, earning her undergrad in humanities and a graduate business degree. Though she continues developing expertise with industry and technical certifications, Deana reflects often on the early, nontechnical jobs that don’t appear on her Linked In profile. They taught her how to move out of her comfort zone as an introvert. 
## professional nerd

Deana can be either the least or most technical person in any setting. And no matter what, she'll find some data to nerd out about. She draws from over two decades of technology and infrastructure management roles to inform her approach to [FinOps](https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/){:target="_blank"}. She was named Evangelist of the Year at the inaugural [FinOpsX conference](https://youtu.be/-It8MhfTdmQ?t=1116){:target="_blank"}, and serves as a FinOps Foundation ambassador.

## leaving all the things better than she found them

Justice, equity, belonging and inclusion are neither defaults nor dead. Uncomfortable conversations, confronting unconscious bias and demanding safety for groups that have been marginalized, underpin her dedication to humanizing tech. She continues to volunteer, mentor, and hold the door open for those coming next.
